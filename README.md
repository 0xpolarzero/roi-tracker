# ROI Tracker

A basic tracking app for your wallets. It allows you to add different addresses (hot wallet, cold wallet, burn wallets, any kind of wallet) and trace your expanses to calculate the ROI in short periods of time : 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week.

It would consider transfers between wallets, gas spent, ETH/WETH swaps, buying/selling on various plateforms...

Demo not available yet, it's still fuzzy and nonfunctional :)
